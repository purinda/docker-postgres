# Postgres Docker Image Builder

The purpose of the repository is to be generic enough that most of the Postgres
server versions can be built by using this repository.

The scripts in the repo uses generic notes and installation instructions from
https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/static/installation.html

# Why

The official Postgres docker repository only contains the images for the current
major version and its minor version builds.
